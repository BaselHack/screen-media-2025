# BaselHack 2024 Screen Media

Contains a remotion project with compositions:
* JobWall
* SponsorVideos

These are intended to be rendered in a video file each.

Additionally, HelloWorld and OnlyLogo from the original remotion template are still there for documentation.

Raw assets (under public/) are not committed to git, for filesize reasons. We have them in our google drive.
These are the files referenced with the staticFile() function.
